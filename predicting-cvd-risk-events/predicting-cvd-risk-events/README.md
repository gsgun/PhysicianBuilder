# Predicting CVD Risk Events

Goal: Develop custom solution for ASCVD CVD Risk Scores from source material. Verified about citation and utilization. Integrate new G codes for ASCVD Risk Assessment and Management



CER Rules

* Most of the rules are for the smartform or to return/evaluate a variable contained in the smartform
* Scores are run via flowsheet

ETX

* Standard Note\Tip Text Build
  * Parent = {tip text, output (ELT)}
  * HHS Smartlink to Parent Smarttext

FLO

* Risk Scores are hard coded formulas. Custom List flowsheets allow for overrides of the variables

LQF&#x20;

* This is my first smartform and by far the worst due to complexity of checks
* See Cath PCI GDMT for cleaner build logic
